- [ ] Information disclosure prevention

## 9. Multi-Organization Functionality

### Core Features
- [ ] User can belong to multiple organizations
- [ ] Organization switching works correctly
- [ ] Data isolation between organizations
- [ ] Role persistence across organizations
- [ ] Permission inheritance per organization

### Integration Tests
